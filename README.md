## Inspiration

### Selling Artwork Online
Selling artwork online is about more than just putting up a pretty picture. Showcasing products visually is only half the story —  the right words make all the difference. Artists need descriptions that capture the essence of each artwork and make viewers feel something special.

### The Challenge of Descriptive Writing
For many artists and small business owners, writing compelling text to accompany visuals is a real challenge. Sure, the artworks look beautiful. However, finding the right words to spark desire in potential buyers takes true skill.

### Data Revelation
Analyzing e-commerce data revealed a sobering truth—for artists to earn a livable income from art online required selling thousands of prints a year. This is an immense volume of individual artworks requiring customized descriptions! Spending hours manually writing unique text for each artwork couldn’t scale. Artists desperately needed a way to streamline transforming their visuals into compelling, tailored descriptions in just minutes, not days.

### Rekindling Creativity in Digital Marketing
At its core, AIT-MARKI is all about connection and collaboration between users and the AI. In a digital world full of sterile, automated marketing, we bring back creativity's intimate spark. With artist’s creative thinking and AI's conceptual reach, AIT-MARKI can create truly compelling marketing messages that help viewers to fully connect with their art. Our narratives whisper the unspoken essence of each work right into art lovers' hearts.

## What it Does

![AIT-MARKI Banner](https://github.com/aitrailblazer/AIT-MARKI/blob/main/images/AIT-MARKI_02.jpg?raw=true)

### Bridging Art and Commerce

Selling art online is no small feat. You need more than just a pretty picture to capture hearts and make a sale. That's where AIT-MARKI comes in - the AI assistant built to bring art to life through words.

### Specialized Process for Rich Narratives

Our specialized process helps galleries and artists turn images into emotionally resonant stories. First, AIT-MARKI scans a piece to extract keywords and visual details. But technology alone can't encapsulate artistic essence. So creators refine the computer-generated insights by adding their own experiential understanding.

### Symbiosis of Human and Machine

This symbiosis of human and machine sets the foundation for AIT-MARKI’s semantic narration. The AI crafts a captivating product description that summarizes the core feelings and meanings of the art. We then take it a step further to choose an evocative title and dive into the emotional triggers that forge connections with potential buyers.

### Authentic Digital Content

The end result is authentic digital content that goes beyond a sterile summary. AIT-MARKI brings back the intimate spark between art and audience through messaging that resonates with the heart.

### Seamless Integration with Square

The process culminates in effortless integration with Square's online catalog. Listings are published or updated with a simple click, enriched by AIT-MARKI's narrative touch.

### Elevating Creators' Unique Voices

Selling art online is now easier and more engaging than ever. AIT-MARKI elevates creators' unique voices through the harmony of human creativity and AI. Now every product page tells a compelling story that resonates deeply with art lovers. That's how galleries make the emotional sale.

## How we built it

### Bringing Artistry to E-commerce

Bringing artistry to e-commerce takes more than just coding skills. Building AIT-MARKI required harmonizing technological sophistication with human creativity.

### Utilizing Google's Imagen

We started by leveraging the power of AI through Google's Imagen. Automated image analysis extracts the visual essence of each artwork by identifying keywords, colors, and objects.

### Balancing Technology with Human Insight

But even the most advanced technology cannot fully encapsulate the nuances of art. That's why creators refine the computer-generated insights by adding their own contextual understanding of each piece.

### Crafting Semantic Descriptions

This fusion of machine learning and human input allows AIT-MARKI to generate semantic descriptions that capture the core feelings and meanings of each artwork. 

### Generating Emotional Resonance

We go further by crafting emotionally resonant titles and diving into the psychological triggers that make buyers connect with a piece.

### Elevating Art Listings

The end result is authentic digital content that brings back art's intimate spark. We designed AIT-MARKI'S 7-step process to elevate listings from sterile summaries to compelling narratives that resonate with the heart.

### Seamless Integration with Square

Integrating this narrative content into Square's online catalog completes the loop, making emotional art sales effortless. Sellers can publish and update enriched listings with one click.

### Charting New Territory

Building AIT-MARKI required charting new territory at the intersection of technology and creativity.

### Collaborative Synthesis

Through collaborative synthesis, we developed an AI assistant that simplifies e-commerce while letting the unique essence of each art piece shine through. AIT-MARKI puts care back into content and connection back into art.

## Overcoming Challenges on the Road to Innovation
